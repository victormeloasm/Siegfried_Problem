Siegfried Problem using Monte Carlo Simulation 


"In one scene Siegfried wonders if mothers always die when they give birth to a boy (he doesn't know any better but knows that his mother died giving birth to him). If this were the case, i.e. a woman can give birth to a girl or a boy with 50/50 changes but dies when she gives birth to a boy, what would be the distribution of boys/girls in the population. Assume a finite life span for girls and boys and write a little simulation." - Bernd Ulmann
